# Dew It

## Client Conversation

Client - "I would like a simple to-do list app where I can create list items, edit them and delete them. I should be able to type the description of the list item and it should appear in a list below in a box. I would like a button to delete the items and when I have completed a task I would like to press a tick button and have an indication that the task has been completed. 
I would also like to see Nasa's photo of the day and have another fun widget on the side. However, this is only a stretch goal and isn't necessary. In the design, just leave the space to add it later.
Go away now and DO IT"

Me - "Youuuuuu got it üëç.

Me - "Is this ok, I make da design meself?"

Client - "Cool, nice job, I like the reference buuuuuuuuuuutt, something seems off the theme, the colours. I want more space wars"

Me - "You mean Star Wars?"

Client - "ü§´ Shhhhh Disney are listening"

Me - "Youuuuuu got it üëç. MVP 2 coming up"

## Feature List

- text field to input list item
- button to enter the item into the list
- tick button
- indication that the task has been completed
- delete button for list items
- layout to include space for future developments

## UCD

- I wanted to add the APIs because a to-do list may be a place that you visit every day. A photo of the day felt like a good idea as well as a joke that you can use throughout the day.
- I used a random fact API at first however I kept getting a 500 status error so I changed it to a random joke API.

## Design

### Colour Palette

I wanted some muted colours for the design and a great resource I have found is the website [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). It offers great colour palette-finding features.

Green Orange and Red should be used as people are used to these colours to signify done and delete. 

Below are two palettes that I decided to use. Nice and colourful.
