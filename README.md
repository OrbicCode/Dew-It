# JS-Todo-List
JavaScript todo list app with CRUD functionality

User Story

  I would like a simple todo list app where I can create list items, edit them and delete them. I should be able to type in the title of the list item and it should appear in a list below. I would like a button to delete the items and when I have completed a task I would like to press a tick button and have an indication that the task has been completed

I would also like to see Nasa's photo of the day and have another fun widget on the side. Though this is only a stretch goal and isn't necessary. In the design, just leave the space to add it in later

Feature List

- textfield to input list item
- button to enter the item into the list
- tick button
- indication that task has been completed
- delete button for list items
- layout to include space for future developments
