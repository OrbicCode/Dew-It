# JS-Todo-List
JavaScript todo list app with CRUD functionality.

## User Story

I would like a simple todo list app where I can create list items, edit them and delete them. I should be able to type in the title of the list item and it should appear in a list below. I would like a button to delete the items and when I have completed a task I would like to press a tick button and have an indication that the task has been completed.

I would also like to see Nasa's photo of the day and have another fun widget on the side. Though this is only a stretch goal and isn't necessary. In the design, just leave the space to add it in later.

## Feature List

- textfield to input list item
- button to enter the item into the list
- tick button
- indication that task has been completed
- delete button for list items
- layout to include space for future developments

### Colour Palette

I wanted some muted colours for the design and a great resource I have found is the website [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). It offers great colour palette finding features.

Below are two palettes that i decided tio use.

## Future Plans

Now that I have developed this project in JavaScript. I want to translate this into a React project using Vite as it is only a one-page app. 

More on this to come soon...
